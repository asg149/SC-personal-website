  <h3>Bio</h3>

  <p>My name is Ansel Gunther and I grew up near the Harrisburg area in Mechanicsburgh. I have lived in the area my entire life with my 5 siblings; four brothers and one sister. Throughout my education I was very STEM focused and outside of school I tried to keep myself busy with extracurriculars. These extracurriculars included my school’s musicals, TSA (a technology competition club), and club soccer where I played keeper. In addition to this I would raise money for my school’s Mini-THON which raises money to combat pediatric cancer. Currently, I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a second year student and am studying computer science. I am also working toward a minor in mathematics which is an interest of mine. Outside of class, I am part of the Computer science club, ping pong club, and skateboarding club. For a career, I would like to work doing research about machine learning and how to best implement it in different situations. I am not very concerned about what field and as long as I am working on creating or implementing cutting edge technology I will be satisfied. Saying this, I would be especially interested in how machine learning could be implemented in medicine or environmental conservation. </p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

  <p1>I have been skateboarding since elementary school as a method of transportation and it is something I really enjoy. I started learning to do tricks much more recently and I have learned how to do a few since. Another of my hobbies is music. I played piano as an elementary schooler and now do some music production as well. I also enjoy drawing when I have the chance and will occasionally draw on clothes that I thrift. Along with these I am interested in logic puzzles, especially sudoku. I play sudoku fairly often and have begun doing more complicated puzzles with extra constraints. Another of my hobbies is soccer. I enjoy playing casual soccer where I usually play keeper or midfield however I am much worse at the wing than I am in goal.</p1>

<!--note the "style="color: white;"" in the parallax section. How would this look if we kept up the standard "textblock" style? Try it out by erasing the "style="color: white;""-->

<!--You could set up your whole site with parallax sections if you wanted. Try and wrap another div in parralax. Or just add a heading and paragraph element inside the parallax div to see what you'll get. It's important to experiment. -->

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>I do not have any real work experience in the field but I have worked a number of jobs in the past. I started by working at a shoe store called Journeys before my freshman year of high-school. The next summer I started working at a Five Guys location near me. I worked at this location as a team member until half way through my sophmore school year. At that point I began working at the local Jimmy Johns where I started as a team member. I worked at that location for the remainder of high school until moving to Pittsburgh. In this time, I got promoted to shift manager and again later to catering manager. I also returned to work at the Jimmy Johns this past summer. I hope to work at Pitt doing research this coming summer but I also plan to work another job alongside any research I do. </p>
